# Challenges

This repository serves as the central hub for all challenge material of the Winter School 2026 on **AI for Earth System, Hazards & Climate Extremes**.

Each challenge is hosted in a dedicated repository within this organization.  
All challenges are designed to be completed using **Google Colab**.

### Nikolas Papadopoulos  
**Challenge 01 – SeasFire**

Nikolas Papadopoulos is a PhD candidate on AI for extreme weather events at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). Combining his physics background with data-driven methods, his research bridges Earth system science and machine learning, with a focus on high socio-environmental impact problems. His past work includes deep learning methods for volcanic activity monitoring and subseasonal-to-seasonal wildfire danger forecasting.

### Arianna Olivelli  
**Challenge 03 – Using machine learning to assess ocean deoxygenation trends in space and time**

Arianna Olivelli is a chemical oceanographer and Postdoctoral Researcher in the Past, Present and Future Marine Climate Change group led by Peter Landschützer at the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ), Belgium. Her research focuses on the impacts of human activities on marine climate change, including carbon and oxygen cycles and environmental pollution from trace metals and plastics. She holds a PhD in Marine Isotope Geochemistry from Imperial College London and combines ocean biogeochemistry with data science and machine learning approaches. She is also active in science communication and outreach, promoting accessibility and diversity in STEM.
