### Alexander Winkler  
**Challenge 06**

Alex is an Earth system scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry and a core member of the ELLIS Unit Jena. His research focuses on the interactions between the atmosphere and biosphere, particularly their role in climate feedbacks. After earning his PhD in Earth system modeling at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology and the University of Hamburg in 2019, he worked within the CLICCS Cluster of Excellence. Since 2020, he has been part of the ERC Synergy Grant “USMILE” at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, where he leads the “Atmosphere-Biosphere Coupling, Climate, and Causality” Research Group.

Alex uses models—from simple frameworks to advanced Earth system models—and machine learning to explore CO2, water, and energy exchanges between land and atmosphere. His work emphasizes causal inference and hybrid models, combining data-driven and mechanistic approaches to advance process understanding.

### Fangfei "Fei" Lan  
**Challenge 07**

Fangfei (Fei) Lan is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Lausanne, working with Dr. Tom Beucler on AI for climate science as part of AI4PEX. Her research focuses on evaluating machine learning-based hybrid Earth system models, and exploring novel methodologies, such as topological data analysis (TDA), to advance climate modeling and scientific discoveries. She earned her Ph.D. in Computing in 2024 from the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute at the University of Utah, advised by Dr. Bei Wang. Her doctoral work centered on TDA and scientific visualization, applying algebraic and computational topology to the analysis and visualization of high-dimensional scientific data. During her Ph.D., she was a visiting researcher in the immersive visualization group at Linköping University in Sweden, collaborating with Dr. Alexander Bock and Dr. Anders Ynnerman on visualization for astrophysics. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computational Science from American University, where she was introduced to topology by applied mathematician Dr. Michael Robinson, whose mentorship sparked her path into TDA research.
